You must perform all the following checks after completing any code change. If a folder is provided, then only do the checks for the provided folder.

## Quality Assurance Requirements
Always run tests and linters after completing work using these standard commands:

### Code Quality
- `make ruff-format` for code formatting
- `make lint-check-lib-main` for linting and type checking the main library
- `make lint-check-lib-ds` for linting and type checking the data science components
- `make lint-check-pkg` for linting and type checking the orchestration package

### Testing
- `make test-lib-main` for testing the main library
- `make test-lib-ds` for testing the data science components
- `make test-pkg` for testing the orchestration package

## Execution Order
1. Run formatting first: `make ruff-format`
2. Run combined linting and type checking: `make lint-check-lib-main`, `make lint-check-lib-ds`, `make lint-check-pkg`
3. Run tests: `make test-lib-main`, `make test-lib-ds`, `make test-pkg`
