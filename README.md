Quick parity/export guide

1) Train locally

   - Run your training as usual. It should produce:
     - models/recurrent_model.pth
     - models/best_params.json

2) Export NumPy weights

   - Requires torch CPU in a Python 3.10â€“3.12 env.
   - Command:
     python3 export_npz_from_pth.py --pth models/recurrent_model.pth --out models

   - This generates models/recurrent_model_np.npz and bumps its mtime to be newer than the .pth.

3) Parity check (optional, recommended)

   - Command:
     python3 compare_backends.py

   - Expect near-zero diffs for base_metabolism_kcal and W_adj_pred.

4) Deploy on Render

   - Upload these three files to /app/models/ in the container:
     - recurrent_model_pth
     - recurrent_model_np.npz
     - best_params.json

   - The API will prefer NumPy if the .npz exists and is as new as (or newer than) the .pth.
